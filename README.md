A SASS library that provides some common functions, mixins, and classes for faster frontend development.

It's been used for over 5 years now for various projects and is in continuous development.

The library follows [a common namespacing convention](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/) so every mixin or class is prefixed with `u-`.

It doesn't contain any functions that may be fully delegated to existing packages (such as working with media queries, grids and so on).
